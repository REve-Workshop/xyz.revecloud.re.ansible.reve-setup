#### User definition
# The name of the user
# Must be a valid user name for the target OS
name: user-example
# One-line text to be inserted in the description field of the user
# definition in /etc/passwd.
comment: Example of user definition using Ansible playbooks from REVE Workshop
# What aspect of the user must be handled?
# - config: Only the configuration will be updated/deployed
# - create: The user will be created and nothing else
# - all: All the aspects of the user will be handled
# - none: Nothing must be done for this user.
state: all
#
# The $HOME directory will be /home/{{ user.name }}/
#
# $XDG_CONFIG_HOME will be used in this file to refer to the directory
# /home/{{ user.name }}/.config/.
#
# Directory in user $HOME dire where the working directory of the
# configuration's repositories of the user must be deployed.
root_repo_dir: codes
#
# The shell the user want to use.
# If absent, will default to /bin/bash
shell: /bin/zsh
#
# Is the user a system user (sudo access)
# If absent, will default to False.
system: False
#
# The password of the user.
# The password must be stored in a file encrypted with ansible-vault.
password: "{{ user_example_pwd_from_vault }}"

#### Application's configuration of the user
configurations:
  # To define an application's configration, define a dictionnary named
  # after the application's name in the "group_vars/" or "host_vars/"
  # configuration files.
  #
  # Configuration's definition for an application:
  app_conf:
  # Specifiy if the configuration must be updated/deployed for the
  # application.
  # Possible values:
  # - True
  # - False
    config: False
  #
  # By default, all applications are supposed to be XDG compliant with
  # regard to the location of the configuration. To override that
  # behaviour, The following field can be set to False.
    xdg_compliant: True
  #
  # Is it necessary to remove the current configuration directory in
  # $XDG_CONFIG_HOME, before deploying the new version?
    delete_xdgdir_first: True
  #
  # Working directory of the configuration's repository.  This is a
  # path relative to the path specified in root_repo_dir.
    dir: app-conf
  #
  # The target directory of the configuration files in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME.
    xdgdir: $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/app_dir
  #
  # The URL to the configuration's repository the user relies on.
    repo: <https://example.repository.org/path/to/repo.git>
  #
  # The list of files to copy from the repository to xdgdir. If the
  # files contain path, the playbook will ensure the directories
  # exists.
  # If the configuration of an application doesn't follow the XDG
  # specification or the configuration is not about updating files,
  # the dictionnary can be omitted. Usually, a dedicated role or task
  # has been designed to handle the configuration of that application.
